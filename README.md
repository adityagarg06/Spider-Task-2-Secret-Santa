# Spider-Task-2-Secret-Santa
Secret Santa
You and your friends plan to pay Secret Santa this year. You don’t want to do it manually as people are changing the names they got, so you decide to create a website for it so that they can’t change it.

Basic Mode:
• Users should be able to sign in and register securely. No frameworks like passport.js should be used to implement authorization. Passwords must be hashed (for hashing npm packages can be used).
• Users should be able to create an exchange group (a group in which people joined will exchange gifts between them). Get information like name, date, registration date, budget, location, etc
• Generate a code which can be used by users to join an exchange.
• Create a detailed page for each exchange which is visible to the participants, display details collected while creating it and the list of participants.
